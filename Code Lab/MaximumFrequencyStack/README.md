895. Maximum Frequency Stack

Implement `FreqStack`, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like
data structure.

`FreqStack` has two functions:

-   `push(int x)`, which pushes an integer `x` onto the stack.

-   `pop()`, which **removes** and returns the most frequent element in the
    stack.

    -   If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the
        top of the stack is removed and returned.
